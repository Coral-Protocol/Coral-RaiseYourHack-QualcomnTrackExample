# Personal Finance Advisor

This project is a comprehensive personal finance advisor system that combines the [Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent) and [Monzo Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Monzo-Agent) to provide secure, intelligent, and privacy-preserving financial management through natural language interaction. The Monzo Agent enables users to safely access and analyze their Monzo banking data using a local LLM, ensuring sensitive information never leaves their device. By integrating with Monzoâ€™s official API and customized toolkits, the system supports conversational account balance checks, transaction history queries, and personalized financial advice. All agents in this project are part of the [Awesome Agents for Multi-Agent Systems](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/awesome-agents-for-multi-agent-systems) collection.
