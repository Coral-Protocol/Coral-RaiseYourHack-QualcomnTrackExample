# Coral Raise Your Hack Guide

## About Raise Your Hack üíª
This is your chance to push boundaries, solve real-world challenges, and create impact at the official hackathon of the [RAISE Summit 2025](https://www.raisesummit.com/) at one of Paris's most iconic venues: Le Carrousel du Louvre. RAISE Summit 2025 is a premier event convening the brightest minds across industries to accelerate innovation and drive the future of entrepreneurship, AI, and technology.

## About Coral Protocol ü™∏

The [Coral Protocol](https://www.coralprotocol.org/) is an initiative to create an open, standardized infrastructure for AI agent coordination. It builds on the MCP framework to enable multiple AI agents to work together collaboratively, addressing the limitation of isolated AI systems that lack mechanisms for interconnected workflows. The Coral Protocol focuses on:

- Agent Collaboration: Allowing AI agents to communicate, share tasks, and coordinate in a structured way.

- Messaging Layer: Providing a system for agents to exchange messages, similar to human messaging platforms, with features like threads and mentions.

- Scalability and Openness: Designing an extensible, open-source solution that can support a wide range of AI applications, from customer support to project management.

We released the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) as an open-source MCP server to serve as the backbone for this vision. The server acts as a messaging hub where AI agents can register, communicate via threads, and coordinate tasks by mentioning each other. The protocol aims to foster a community-driven ecosystem, encouraging developers to experiment, contribute, and build collaborative AI systems.

## About the Tracks üéØ

Coral Protocol is encouraged for teams interested in multi-agent systems, allowing them to integrate open-source agents from any framework. With its thread-based agent architecture, Coral enables scalable and predictable multi-agent interactions, making it a powerful tool for innovative applications. Build on one of the below tracks using Coral Protocol.

### Qualcomm Track

üß† Edge AI Consumer Utility Application

<details>

Build a powerful, AI-driven utility app for everyday users‚Äîright at the edge.
In this track, you'll will develop a consumer-facing utility application that runs entirely on-device using the Snapdragon X Elite platform. The challenge is to harness the power of Edge AI to create a tool that is both useful and accessible to a broad audience‚Äîwithout relying on cloud connectivity.

üîç What We‚Äôre Looking For:

‚Ä¢ Consumer-Oriented: The app should appeal to a wide range of users and offer clear, everyday value.
‚Ä¢ Utility-Focused: It must help users accomplish a task‚Äîwhether it's organizing, creating, assisting, or enhancing their experience.
‚Ä¢ Edge AI-Powered: The core functionality should include a probabilistic AI component (e.g., computer vision, audio processing, or generative AI) that runs locally in a resource-constrained environment.
‚Ä¢ Cross-Platform: While the app targets Snapdragon X Elite, it should be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
‚Ä¢ Developer-Ready: Submissions should include a GitHub repository with setup and run instructions. A polished consumer UI is not required‚Äîfocus on functionality and innovation.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Flexibility:

‚Ä¢ Use any programming language or framework.
‚Ä¢ Combine multiple AI modalities (CV, audio, Gen AI) as needed.
‚Ä¢ No internet connection should be required for core functionality.

Qualcomm will directly ship the Copilot+ PC with the Snapdragon¬Æ X Elite (loaner devices) to selected participants and collect them at the conclusion of the hackathon.

The hardware will be shipped on June 30th with next-day delivery.

### 1. How to set up local model:

<details>

<summary>Click to expand Ollama instructions</summary>

Monzo Agent uses Ollama to run local LLM. Please make sure you have Ollama installed and the desired model downloaded before running the agent.

**1. Install Ollama**

- **Linux/macOS:**
  Follow the official instructions: [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
  Or run:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
  ```
- **Windows:**
  Download the installer from [Ollama's website](https://ollama.com/download).

**2. Download Local model**

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:latest
```

**3. Start Ollama Service**

Ollama usually starts automatically. If not, start it manually:
```bash
ollama serve
```

**4. Verify the model is running**

```bash
ollama list
```
Make sure no errors occur and Ollama is running at `http://localhost:11434`.

<summary>Click to expand sample input/output</summary>

#### 1. Input

```bash
Help me check my transections of monzo for the last 2 months and give me some personal finance advice.
```

#### 2. Output

```bash
Answer: Here is a summary of your Monzo transactions for the past 2 months:
- May 1: -¬£22.00 (University, bills)
- May 14: -¬£120.00 (Person A, general)
- May 14: -¬£20.81 (Mobile Provider, bills)
- May 18: -¬£16.00 (Person A, general)
- May 19: +¬£9.00 (Person B, income)
- June 2: -¬£22.00 (University, bills)
- June 6: +¬£6.66 (From Person C, income)
- June 12: -¬£20.81 (Mobile Provider, bills)
- June 17: +¬£100.00 (From Person C, income)

Notable spending patterns:
- Regular bills to University and Mobile Provider.
- Significant general spending to "Person A."
- Income from Person B and Person C.

Personalized financial advice:
1. **Track Recurring Bills:** Your regular payments to University and Mobile Provider are predictable. Consider setting up automated budgeting for these to ensure you always have funds allocated.
2. **Review Large Expenses:** The ¬£120 payment to "Person A" stands out. Review such large transactions to ensure they are necessary and look for ways to reduce or avoid them if possible.
3. **Increase Savings:** Try to set aside a portion of your income (even small amounts) right after you receive it. Automating savings can help build a financial cushion.
4. **Monitor Cash Flow:** Your income is irregular. Consider ways to stabilize your income or reduce discretionary spending during lower-income months.
5. **Analyze General Spending:** Categorize your general expenses to identify areas where you can cut back.
