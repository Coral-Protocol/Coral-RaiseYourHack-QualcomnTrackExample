# Personal Finance Advisor

This project is a comprehensive personal finance advisor system that combines the [Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent) and [Monzo Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Monzo-Agent) to provide secure, intelligent, and privacy-preserving financial management through natural language interaction. The Monzo Agent enables users to safely access and analyze their Monzo banking data using a local LLM, ensuring sensitive information never leaves their device. By integrating with Monzoâ€™s official API and customized toolkits, the system supports conversational account balance checks, transaction history queries, and personalized financial advice. All agents in this project are part of the [Awesome Agents for Multi-Agent Systems](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/awesome-agents-for-multi-agent-systems) collection.

# Input:
Question: Help me check my transections of monzo for the last 2 months and give me some personal finance advice.

# Output:
Answer: Here is a summary of your Monzo transactions for the past 2 months:
- May 1: -Â£22.00 (University, bills)
- May 14: -Â£120.00 (Person A, general)
- May 14: -Â£20.81 (Mobile Provider, bills)
- May 18: -Â£16.00 (Person A, general)
- May 19: +Â£9.00 (Person B, income)
- June 2: -Â£22.00 (University, bills)
- June 6: +Â£6.66 (From Person C, income)
- June 12: -Â£20.81 (Mobile Provider, bills)
- June 17: +Â£100.00 (From Person C, income)

Notable spending patterns:
- Regular bills to University and Mobile Provider.
- Significant general spending to "Person A."
- Income from Person B and Person C.

Personalized financial advice:
1. **Track Recurring Bills:** Your regular payments to University and Mobile Provider are predictable. Consider setting up automated budgeting for these to ensure you always have funds allocated.
2. **Review Large Expenses:** The Â£120 payment to "Person A" stands out. Review such large transactions to ensure they are necessary and look for ways to reduce or avoid them if possible.
3. **Increase Savings:** Try to set aside a portion of your income (even small amounts) right after you receive it. Automating savings can help build a financial cushion.
4. **Monitor Cash Flow:** Your income is irregular. Consider ways to stabilize your income or reduce discretionary spending during lower-income months.
5. **Analyze General Spending:** Categorize your general expenses to identify areas where you can cut back.
